## Description<br>

The Movie Card Showcase is a responsive web page designed to present a selection of movies in a visually appealing and organized manner. Each movie card includes the following elements:<br>

- **Badge**: Indicates the status of the movie (e.g., "NOW SHOWING" or "UPCOMING").<br>
- **Image**: A poster of the movie.<br>
- **Title**: The name of the movie.<br>
- **Description**: A brief summary of the movie's plot.<br>
- **Release Year**: The year the movie was released.<br>
- **Main Actors**: Key actors featured in the movie.<br>
- **Tagline**: A short, catchy phrase that encapsulates the essence of the movie.

The layout is created using Bootstrap's grid system, ensuring that the cards are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. Custom CSS is used to maintain a consistent aspect ratio for all movie images, providing a uniform look across the showcase.
